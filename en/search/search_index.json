Strict rules are inconsistent with the voluntary nature of the IGS. However, participating stations should adhere to an agreed set of standards and conventions, which ensure the provision of consistent, fit-for-purpose data. Of particular importance to the IGS products is the stable, long-term operation of the tracking network. Therefore, any changes to station configuration or the surrounding environment should be carefully planned to minimise discontinuities in the station\u2019s position time series. Special consideration should be given to designated reference frame stations that contribute to the realisation of the International Terrestrial Reference Frame<sup>1</sup> (ITRF). This document lists the minimum conventions that all IGS CORS must follow, as well as additional desirable characteristics, which enhance a station's value to the IGS. It is intended to be a useful reference to station owners and operators for planning and operating CORS. Suggestions for additions or changes to these Guidelines are welcomed at cb@igs.org.</p>"},{"location":"#procedure-for-becoming-an-igs-station","title":"Procedure for Becoming an IGS Station","text":"<p>The process for station owners or operators to follow in proposing a new IGS station is outlined in the document \u201cProcedure for Becoming an IGS Station\u201d. In planning the new station proposal, the station operator should carefully review the guidelines contained within this document. The responsible agency must have an expectation that the station will operate perpetually, preferably as part of a national or regional reference network. Stations located within the footprint of a national or regional reference network should first coordinate with the relevant reference network coordinator<sup>2</sup>. Since most of the regional or national reference networks align with IGS standards, prior acceptance within such networks is considered favourable to the IGS. A sub-committee of the IGS Infrastructure Committee (Station Proposal Committee, SPC) will decide whether the proposed station should be accepted into the IGS tracking network based on location, instrumentation, operational characteristics, and whether it is relevant to any IGS Pilot Project or Working Group. The IGS Network Coordinator consults with the station operator through the application process and reviews compiled information for accuracy, completeness and compliance with these Guidelines.</p>"},{"location":"#waivers-for-non-compliant-stations","title":"Waivers for non-compliant Stations","text":"<p>On the occasion that a station does not comply with these Guidelines, but is still valuable to the IGS, a waiver may be granted to include the station within the IGS network, if agreed to by the SPC.</p>"},{"location":"#license","title":"License","text":"<p>These Guidelines are licensed under CC-BY 4.0.</p> <ol> <li> <p>The IGS20.snx contains a listing of stations that contribute to the IGS reference frame.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>The IGS actively coordinates station proposals with the regional networks of APREF, EPN, and SIRGAS.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"summary/","title":"Summary","text":"<p>This section presents an overview of the mandatory and desirable recommendations that need to be fulfilled by a CORS to join the IGS network.

Although using type-mean calibrations is the current standard in the IGS analysis, it is preferred to also calibrate each GNSS used in the IGS network individually. It is recommended that new antennas are either calibrated by a robot or in the chamber.

Although they provide some level of protection from the elements, radomes alter the location of the Antenna Phase Centre (APC). Even worse, as ultraviolet light affects the properties of the radome material, its impact on the APC's location varies. However, environmental conditions such as snowfall, sea spray or the likelihood that the antenna may be used as a perch for birds may require the use of a radome.

Externally running cables can be protected by using buried or secured conduits. Dedicated cableways are recommended within buildings. Cable connectors are potential points of failure when stressed, corroded, or infiltrated by water, dust and pests. The use of a self-amalgamating ultra-violet stabilised tape to protect cable connections is recommended. Tension in the cable at the receiver and antenna connection may place stress on the connection causing failure or intermittent connection. At the antenna this tension may also cause the antenna to rotate. A short loop of excess cable at the antenna and receiver connections is recommended. The quality of antenna cables is categorised by its rated signal loss per metre. Higher grade cables have less signal loss per linear metre at the expense of increased cost and decreased cable flexibility. Each connection along a cable increases the signal loss and adds a potential point of failure.

Mains and solar power are both suitable primary power sources. The choice between solar and mains primary power is a balance of cost, security, availability, and location. A distant connection to the power grid may make solar power with a battery array a more economical choice. Unreliable mains power, with significant power fluctuations, may make solar power preferable, particularly in regional areas.</p> <p>Mains Power Where mains power is used, a dedicated power circuit for the CORS equipment is recommended to reduce the risk that power loads from other equipment may trip a circuit breaker or residual current device and interrupt the power to the CORS equipment. Install mains power outlets in a manner that minimises inadvertent or wilful disconnection of power to the site equipment. It is recommended to install surge protection to prevent damage from power spikes.</p> <p>Solar (Photovoltaic) Power</p> <p>Available sunlight is the key factor for solar performance. This is a function of latitude and local climate conditions. One can check with the local weather agencies for average hours of available sunlight in the target area.</p> <p>A battery system is required for solar powered sites, and is a common secondary power supply for sites with mains primary power. An Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) is a common short term power source, providing power during the switchover between the primary and long-term secondary power sources.</p> <p>A Power Distribution Unit (PDU) is recommended for CORS sites. The PDU manages and conditions the power supply to the site, often with an automatic fall-over/fall-back mechanism to switch between primary and secondary power sources. A remotely managed PDU controls the power system within pre-set limitations and provides system tools, reports and alerts. Depending on the ambient conditions, a PDU may also switch less critical equipment off and back on again. A PDU with a communications link allows the CORS operator to control power to the equipment manually from a remote location.</p>"},{"location":"establishment/power_comms/#communications","title":"Communications","text":"<p>A CORS site requires reliable communications for data transmission, either directly to users, or to an operational data centre (ODC).

The depth of the monument anchor should be chosen in a way that is unaffected by frost action. The monument should be higher than snowfall levels.</p> <p>The width of the top of the monument should be less than the antenna diameter to minimise multipath from the monument edge and upper surface. It is recommended to avoid the amount of metal in close proximity to the antenna. In general, materials with low coefficients of thermal expansion should be used when high temperature variations are expected. If thermal expansion is a concern, insulation should be implemented. Aluminium monuments should be avoided due to the increased thermal expansion of aluminium. Roof monuments should place the antenna a minimum of 50 centimetres above the roof. Avoid structures with a metal roof where possible. If a structure with a metal roof or other reflective surface is used, avoid antenna heights that are multiples of GNSS carrier phase wavelengths (19 or 24 cm).</p> <p>Use stainless steel bolts and fittings. Use through-bolts that penetrate the entire wall thickness for solid concrete walls unless the through bolt fitting will be exposed in an interior workspace such as an office or hallway.
