# IGS CORS Guidelines

The IGS tracking network is a collection of Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) maintained and operated by a variety of different organisations pooling their resources under the umbrella of the IGS for the common good. Strict rules are inconsistent with the voluntary nature of the IGS. However, participating stations should adhere to an agreed set of standards and conventions, which ensure the provision of consistent, fit-for-purpose data. Of particular importance to the IGS products is the stable, long-term operation of the tracking network. Therefore, any changes to station configuration or the surrounding environment should be carefully planned to minimise discontinuities in the stationâ€™s position time series. Special consideration should be given to designated reference frame stations that contribute to the realisation of the International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF).

This document lists the minimum conventions that all IGS CORS must follow, as well as additional desirable characteristics, which enhance a station's value to the IGS. It is intended to be a useful reference to station owners and operators for planning and operating CORS. Suggestions for additions or changes to these Guidelines are welcomed at [cb@igs.org](mailto:cb@igs.org).
