The IGS uses an email distribution system to inform the community about events related to the network. A complete list of IGS mailing lists can be found on the IGS website17. Station operators are requested to subscribe and track the following lists to remain informed about the activities in the IGS:

- IGS Mail
- IGS Station

An advisory to the IGS Station list must be sent in the following cases:

- Station status message that could affect position solutions or require an IGS metadata update, e.g., changes in antenna, radome, receiver and receiver settings, cabling, frequency standard or environment (tree clearing, building constructions, etc.),
- Planned changes to the station (e.g., antenna or receiver change) should be announced at least one day prior to the change,
- Expected data outage for more than one week,
- Corrected IGS metadata,
- Resubmission of data due to corruption or incorrect metadata.

Briefly describe in the message what has changed. The subject of the email must start with the nine-character station code so that the email can be archived automatically.
