**IGS Guidelines for Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS)**

*Version 1.0.0*

The IGS tracking network is a collection of Continuously Operating Reference Stations (CORS) maintained and operated by a variety of different organisations pooling their resources under the umbrella of the IGS for the common good. Strict rules are inconsistent with the voluntary nature of the IGS. However, participating stations should adhere to an agreed set of standards and conventions, which ensure the provision of consistent, fit-for-purpose data. Of particular importance to the IGS products is the stable, long-term operation of the tracking network. Therefore, any changes to station configuration or the surrounding environment should be carefully planned to minimise discontinuities in the station’s position time series. Special consideration should be given to designated reference frame stations that contribute to the realisation of the International Terrestrial Reference Frame[^1] (ITRF).
This document lists the minimum conventions that all IGS CORS must follow, as well as additional desirable characteristics, which enhance a station's value to the IGS. It is intended to be a useful reference to station owners and operators for planning and operating CORS. Suggestions for additions or changes to these Guidelines are welcomed at [cb@igs.org](mailto:cb@igs.org).

## Procedure for Becoming an IGS Station

The process for station owners or operators to follow in proposing a new IGS station is outlined in the document “[Procedure for Becoming an IGS Station](https://files.igs.org/pub/resource/guidelines/Procedure_for_Becoming_an_IGS_Station_v1.0.pdf)”. In planning the new station proposal, the station operator should carefully review the guidelines contained within this document. The responsible agency must have an expectation that the station will operate perpetually, preferably as part of a national or regional reference network. Stations located within the footprint of a national or regional reference network should first coordinate with the relevant reference network coordinator[^2]. Since most of the regional or national reference networks align with IGS standards, prior acceptance within such networks is considered favourable to the IGS. A sub-committee of the IGS Infrastructure Committee (Station Proposal Committee, SPC) will decide whether the proposed station should be accepted into the IGS tracking network based on location, instrumentation, operational characteristics, and whether it is relevant to any IGS Pilot Project or Working Group.
The IGS Network Coordinator consults with the station operator through the application process and reviews compiled information for accuracy, completeness and compliance with these Guidelines.

## Waivers for non-compliant Stations

On the occasion that a station does not comply with these Guidelines, but is still valuable to the IGS, a waiver may be granted to include the station within the IGS network, if agreed to by the SPC.
