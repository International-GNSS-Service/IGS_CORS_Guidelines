Each IGS CORS is expected to have high-quality data. The following parameters and metrics should be fulfilled.

- All (available) satellite systems, frequencies, and signals are tracked and the all-in-view tracking is activated.
- The station ideally has a multipath below 30 cm for each satellite constellation.
- The number of observations should be above 95% (observed vs. expected) for an elevation of 5Â°.
- The station has a low number of cycle slips (<1 per 1000 observations).
- A phase convergence in PPP analysis < 15 mm.
